      NXBoot enables running custom boot code on Tegra X1 devices such as the Nintendo Switch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Batteries are not included: This application contains relocators and {re}switched's demo binaries, but you will have to import custom payloads with actual functionality first.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is recommended that you become familiar with the Nintendo Switch homebrew community prior to using this application.
      Early boot code has full access to the device it runs on and can damage it.
      Nintendo is known to ban modified devices from online services if such modification is detected.

      An OTG adapter is required for connecting your iOS device to the Nintendo Switch. The following configuration is known work:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Apple Lightning USB Camera Adapter on the iOS device, connected to...</li>
      <li>any USB 3 Type A  male to USB 3 Type C male cable, connected to...</li>
      <Li>the Nintendo Switch</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A direct Lightning to USB 3 Type C cable (without OTG adapter in between) does not work.
      Third-party OTG adapters <i>may</i> work, but your mileage may vary.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are multiple methods for importing payloads:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Store the payload in any container that is visible in your iOS Files app.</li>
      <li>Transfer the file into the app using iTunes (may not work on all jailbroken firmwares.)</li>
      <li>Copy the files into the app's Documents folder via SSH.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Create Boot Profiles by opening the Boot Code List from the app's start page and selecting <i>Add Profile</i>.
      Files transferred through iTunes/SSH appear in the file selection list along with built-in options.
    </p>
    <p>
      A description and two files must be provided:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The first file is the relocator binary.</b>
      The relocator is responsible for cleaning up the boot session and preparing the payload for execution.
      Most payloads want <i>intermezzo.bin</i>, which is shipped with this app. For loading Coreboot/Linux you must import a copy of <i>cbfs.bin</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The second file is the payload.</b>
      For Coreboot/Linux this file is usually named coreboot.rom. Other well-known payloads are <i>fusee.bin</i> and the Hekate bootloader <i>hekate_ctcaer_X.Y.bin</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The selected relocator and payload files are copied to this application's storage, so that they don't have to remain in iOS' Files or cloud storage.
    </p>

    <h1><a name="section-booting">Booting the Target Device</a></h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Select your Boot Code on this application's start page after importing it.</li>
      <li>Tap this app's <i>Boot Now</i> button.</li>
      <li>Enter RCM mode on the Nintendo Switch.</li>
      <li>Connect the Nintendo Switch via USB.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      A warning about an unsupported accessory appears and can be ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always power on the Nintendo Switch prior to connecting it. Otherwise iOS will disconnect the device for consuming too much power.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Enter RCM mode by 1. shorting the home pin to a ground pin on the right Joy-Con rail, 2. holding down Volume +, 3. tapping the POWER button once.</li>
      <li>In RCM the screen remains black, but the device is detected as 'APX' by PCs and will work with this app.</li>
      <li>Exit RCM mode without booting custom code by holding the POWER button for 12 seconds.</li>
    </ul>
