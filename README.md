# Fusée Loader for iOS

This application enables provisioning a Tegra X1 powered device with early boot code using an iOS device.

Example use for this application: Boot the Lakka Linux Distrobution (RetroArch) on a supported Nintendo Switch.

## Disclaimer

Early boot code has full access to the device it runs on and can damage it. No boot code is shipped with this application. Be careful what you run and in either case, responsibility for consequences of using this application and executing boot code remains with the user. This tool is a hammer - don't complain that it can smash stuff.

## Prerequisites

* iOS 10 or later
* A cable or adapter for Lightning to USB Type C (less than $10, shipped with some Apple products)

## Installation
